# Test Strategy

Choose tests that prove behavior without turning every task into strict TDD.

## First Decision

- If the user asks for strict TDD, use TDD mode.
- If adding regression coverage for a bug, choose the narrowest seam that reproduces the real failure pattern.
- If improving or adding tests, prefer observable behavior through public interfaces.
- If the task is ordinary implementation and tests are not central, do not force a test-first workflow.

## Testing Defaults

- Test what the system does, not how internal collaborators are called.
- Prefer integration-style tests through public APIs, UI behavior, endpoints, CLI commands, or service boundaries.
- Keep each test focused on one behavior or one regression.
- Use existing project test tools, fixtures, naming, and setup patterns.
- Run the smallest relevant test command first; widen only when risk justifies it.
- Prefer vertical slices: one behavior, one proving test or small group, then implementation. Do not write all tests first and all code later.

Read [good-tests.md](references/good-tests.md) when the test shape itself is the main question.

## TDD Mode

When the user asks for TDD, red-green-refactor, or test-first work:

1. Pick one behavior.
2. Write one failing test.
3. Run it and confirm it fails for the expected reason.
4. Write only enough implementation to pass.
5. Run the focused test green.
6. Refactor after green, keeping tests green.

Read [tdd-mode.md](references/tdd-mode.md) for stricter details.

## Mocks

Mock system boundaries such as external APIs, time, randomness, slow services, or filesystem access when using the real thing is costly or unreliable.

Do not mock internal collaborators by default. Do not assert that a mock component or mock function exists unless that is the behavior the user cares about.

Read [mocking.md](references/mocking.md) when mocks, test doubles, or mock-heavy failures are involved.

## Flaky Tests

For timing, async, or intermittent failures, wait for the condition that proves progress instead of sleeping for a guessed duration. Read [flaky-tests.md](references/flaky-tests.md).
