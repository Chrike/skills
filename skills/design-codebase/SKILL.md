# Design Codebase

Use architecture language to improve leverage, locality, and testability without turning ordinary implementation into a design ceremony.

## First Decision

- If the user asks for a small bug fix or ordinary implementation, stay in the lightweight development flow.
- If the user asks where an interface or seam should live, inspect current callers, dependencies, and tests first.
- If the user asks to improve architecture, look for shallow modules and leakage across seams before proposing changes.
- If the design question needs runnable feedback, suggest a throwaway prototype; build it only when the user asks or agrees.
- If the user asks for broad planning, use the planning workflow instead of duplicating it here.

## Vocabulary

Use these terms consistently:

- **Module**: anything with an interface and implementation.
- **Interface**: everything callers must know to use the module correctly, including invariants, ordering, errors, configuration, and performance.
- **Implementation**: what lives behind the interface.
- **Seam**: the place where behavior can vary without editing callers.
- **Adapter**: a concrete implementation that satisfies an interface at a seam.
- **Depth**: leverage at the interface; deep modules hide useful behavior behind a small surface.
- **Locality**: changes, bugs, and tests concentrate in one place.

## Design Checks

- Deletion test: if deleting the module makes complexity vanish, it was probably shallow. If complexity spreads across callers, it was earning its interface.
- Interface test surface: callers and tests should cross the same seam.
- Real seam test: one adapter is usually hypothetical indirection; two justified adapters make a seam real.
- Dependency fit: pure or local-substitutable dependencies can usually sit behind the module; remote or external dependencies may need ports/adapters.
- Scope fit: improve the architecture needed for the current goal; avoid unrelated broad refactors.

## Boundaries

Do not automatically create glossary files, domain-context files, ADRs, architecture reports, HTML files, prototypes, subagent workflows, or broad refactors.

Only create durable design artifacts when the user asks, or when a hard-to-reverse and surprising trade-off has been explicitly chosen and the user agrees it should be recorded.
