# Review Template

Use when the user asks for a code review, PR review, branch review, or review since a ref.

## Process

1. Identify the scope: changed files, diff range, pasted code, or user-specified files.
2. Read the relevant code and requirements if available.
3. Prioritize bugs, regressions, missing requirements, data loss, security, and test gaps.
4. Avoid style nits unless they affect correctness, maintainability, or documented standards.

## Output

Lead with findings:

```md

Severity guidance:

| Severity | Use For |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | Broken behavior, data loss, security, dangerous operation. |
| Important | Missing requirement, likely regression, poor error handling, serious test gap. |
| Minor | Maintainability, confusing code, low-risk edge case. |

If no issues are found, say that clearly and mention remaining test or verification gaps.
