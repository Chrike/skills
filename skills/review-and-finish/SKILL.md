# Review And Finish

Handle explicit review, review feedback, and completion verification without turning those requests into automatic branch actions.

## First Decision

- User asks for review: inspect the diff/code and report findings first.
- User shares feedback: verify each item against the codebase before changing it.
- User asks whether work is done/fixed/passing: verify with a fresh command or state why verification is unavailable.
- User asks to finish a branch, commit, push, merge, discard, or prepare a PR: hand off to `finish-branch`.
- Ordinary small edit: do not auto-review, commit, push, merge, or start branch cleanup.

Choose the active mode from the user's latest request. Do not blend review, completion verification, and branch actions unless the user explicitly asks for both review and branch wrap-up, and route the branch part through `finish-branch`.

## Review Output

When reviewing, lead with findings ordered by severity. Use file and line references when available. Keep summary secondary.

Use [review-template.md](references/review-template.md) for fuller review shape.

## Feedback Handling

Treat external feedback as input to evaluate, not orders to obey. Clarify unclear multi-item feedback before partial implementation. Implement verified items one at a time and run focused checks.

Use [feedback-handling.md](references/feedback-handling.md) for review-comment workflows.

## Completion Claims

For explicit done/fixed/passing requests, verify with a fresh command or observation when practical and proportionate, then report the actual result, including skipped checks.

Do not treat "tests pass" as automatic proof that the work is done. Check the result against the user's request, review feedback, or stated acceptance context as well.
