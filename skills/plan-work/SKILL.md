description: Use when the user explicitly asks for planning, an implementation plan, approach comparison, task breakdown, roadmap, step-by-step plan, or splitting a feature/refactor into clear implementation slices before coding.

# Plan Work

Plan only when planning will reduce risk or clarify execution. Keep ordinary edits in the lightweight development flow.

## First Decision

- If the user asks only to plan, do not implement until they ask.
- If the task is a small obvious edit, do not create a plan.
- A task being large, medium-complexity, or multi-file is not by itself a planning trigger.
- If requirements are unclear, ask the smallest question that changes scope, risk, or approach.
- If a decision is non-obvious, compare 2-3 approaches with trade-offs and a recommendation.
- If the work is too large for one pass, split it into vertical slices.

## Planning Loop

1. Inspect the relevant code, docs, commands, or prior notes before committing to a plan.
2. State the goal in one sentence.
3. Name constraints that affect the implementation: platform, existing patterns, dependencies, performance, data migration, compatibility, or user workflow.
4. Choose an approach. For meaningful alternatives, explain why the chosen option fits best.
5. Break work into executable steps with likely files, verification points, and dependencies.
6. Call out risks, unknowns, and out-of-scope items.

## Plan Shape

For normal project work, use a compact plan in chat. For handoff, long-running, or multi-session work, write a markdown plan only if the user requests a file or the work needs a durable artifact.

Read [plan-template.md](references/plan-template.md) when producing a durable implementation plan.

Read [vertical-slices.md](references/vertical-slices.md) when splitting a feature, refactor, or PRD into independently useful chunks.

Read [design-questions.md](references/design-questions.md) when the request is still too vague to plan safely.

## Boundaries

Do not automatically create PRDs, specs, ADRs, issues, decision maps, or subagent workflows.

Do not save plans to a project-specific planning path, publish issue tracker items, or require approval gates unless the user asks for that workflow.

When the user says to implement an already-approved plan, execute it instead of re-planning endlessly.
