# Finish Branch

Use this only for explicit branch-ending actions. Keep it manual so ordinary review or implementation does not drift into commit, push, merge, discard, or cleanup behavior.

## First Decision

- If the user asks generally to finish a branch, inspect the current branch state and present concise options.
- If the user asks for a specific branch action, perform only that action after focused safety checks.
- If the user is asking for code review or completion verification rather than a branch action, use `review-and-finish` instead.

## Before Options

1. Inspect git state: branch, status, and relevant diff.
2. Check whether verification is already fresh. If not, run a proportionate project-local check or state the gap.
3. Identify whether the user requested a specific action. If yes, perform only that action after safety checks.

## Options Menu

When the user asks generally to finish a branch, present concise options:

1. Keep branch as-is.
2. Commit locally.
3. Push branch.
4. Create or prepare a PR.
5. Merge locally.
6. Discard work.

Ask which option they want. Do not choose for them.

## Safety Rules

- Do not commit without explicit request and reviewed diff.
- Do not push, merge, force-push, delete, discard, or clean up worktrees without explicit confirmation.
- Require typed confirmation before destructive discard/delete.
- Preserve harness-managed or unknown worktrees.
- Prefer the shell, command style, and project-local checks already used by the repository.
- If tests fail, do not present the work as ready to merge.
