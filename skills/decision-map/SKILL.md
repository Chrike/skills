# Decision Map

Turn long-running uncertainty into a compact frontier map only when ordinary planning is not enough.

## First Decision

- Do not use this for ordinary implementation plans, small refactors, or one-session approach comparison.
- Use this only when the user explicitly wants a durable multi-session decision workflow, decision map, or resume-by-ticket artifact.
- If the path is already clear after discussion, skip the decision map and use `plan-work` or direct implementation instead.
- Keep the map compact because the whole artifact may need to be reread in later sessions.

## What The Map Tracks

Each map should capture:

1. The current decision frontier.
2. Open tickets that must be resolved before downstream choices become clear.
3. Dependencies between tickets.
4. A short answer or outcome for each resolved ticket.
5. Links to supporting artifacts instead of copying large notes into the map.

Use small, numbered tickets. Size each ticket so one agent session can reasonably resolve it.

## Ticket Types

| Type | Use It For | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Research | reading docs, APIs, or external/local references to answer an open question | short linked note or summary |
| Prototype | testing a design or behavior hypothesis in code | throwaway prototype artifact and short conclusion |
| Discuss | resolving uncertainty through focused analysis with the user | concise decision note in the map |

Prefer `Discuss` unless research or a prototype is actually needed.

## Workflow

1. Restate the loose idea or decision space in one sentence.
2. Identify the true open questions, not implementation tasks.
3. Resolve trivial decisions inline instead of turning everything into tickets.
4. Create only the frontier tickets needed to move the decision forward.
5. Record blockers or dependencies between tickets.
6. Stop after creating or updating the map unless the user explicitly asks to resolve a ticket now.

When resuming:

1. Read the whole map first.
2. Resolve the named ticket or the current frontier item.
3. Record the answer compactly.
4. Add, update, or delete downstream tickets if the frontier changed.
5. Stop after the ticket update unless the user asks to continue.

## Boundaries

Do not turn implementation tasks, issue breakdowns, or ordinary design questions into a decision map just because work spans multiple files or feels somewhat ambiguous.

Do not automatically create PRDs, issue tracker items, ADRs, subagents, or broad prototype trees from this skill.

Do not duplicate large research notes in the map. Link to supporting files instead.

Use:

- `plan-work` for ordinary implementation planning
- `design-codebase` for architecture and seam decisions that fit in a normal design discussion
- `issue-workflow` for PRDs, issue breakdown, or tracker-ready work items
- `memory-handoff` when the user wants compression-safe handoff state rather than a decision frontier
